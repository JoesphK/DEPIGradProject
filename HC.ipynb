    "## What is Imputation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imputation** is the process of filling in **missing** or **NaN (Not a Number)** values in a dataset with estimated values. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Impute?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoid Losing Data**: Removing rows or columns with missing values can result in a significant loss of data, especially if the missingness is widespread.\n",
    "- **Maintain Consistency**: Imputation helps preserve the structure and size of the dataset, which is important for analysis and modeling.\n",
    "- **Improve Model Accuracy**: Machine learning models and statistical analyses often require complete data, and imputing missing values can help improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Imputation Strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Imputation** (for numerical data):\n",
    "   - Replace missing values with the **mean** (average) value of the column.\n",
    "   - Best suited for symmetric datasets without many outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median Imputation** (for numerical data):\n",
    "   - Replace missing values with the **median** value of the column.\n",
    "   - Preferred when the data contains outliers since the median is more robust to extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mode Imputation** (for categorical data):\n",
    "   - Replace missing values with the **mode** (most frequent value) of the column.\n",
    "   - This is common for categorical variables where the most frequent category is a reasonable estimate for missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Forward Fill / Backward Fill**:\n",
    "   - **Forward Fill**: Propagate the previous value to fill the missing data.\n",
    "   - **Backward Fill**: Propagate the next value to fill the missing data.\n",
    "   - These methods are typically used in time-series data.\n"
